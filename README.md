hi this is a dartconnect scraper, specifically for FODL match stats

it produces full-season data that includes everything that dartconnect shows, plus some extra stuff. that data is intended to be used by a display thing which is ðŸŽ‰in development ðŸŽ‰ but you can also use it for whatever

you can run it if you have recent-ish node.js installed (8.0 or higher is cool, anything with solid support for ES6). from the command line, `npm install` and wait a minute for it to finish downloading stuff, then `node index.js`

ok bye
